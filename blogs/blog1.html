                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field that bridges human intelligence with machine capabilities. 
                From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI powers some of the most revolutionary technologies of our time. 
                But have you ever wondered what role mathematics plays in AI? Or, more intriguingly, what would AI look like without mathematics?
            </p>

            <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. AI systems can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn from data (Machine Learning)</li>
                    <li>Make decisions (Deep Learning)</li>
                    <li>Understand human language (Natural Language Processing)</li>
                    <li>Recognize objects and patterns (Computer Vision)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Can AI Exist Without Math?</h3>
            <p>
                AI, in its most basic form, could exist without the rigorous math underpinning modern models. 
                Early AI systems, such as rule-based systems, relied more on pre-defined logic than mathematical optimization. 
                However, these systems are highly limited in scalability, learning, and functionality.
            </p>

            <h3>Why is Math Important for AI?</h3>
            <p>
                Mathematics forms the backbone of AI, providing tools like linear algebra, calculus, and probability 
                to build efficient algorithms. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Calculus enables models to minimize errors using gradient descent.</li>
                <li><strong>Probabilistic Reasoning:</strong> Probability handles uncertainty in decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Representation:</strong> Linear algebra helps encode data as vectors and matrices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A neural network, a fundamental AI model, relies heavily on linear algebra:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                AI without math would strip away the intelligence from artificial intelligence, 
                leaving us with rigid, inflexible systems incapable of learning or adaptation. Mathematics 
                is not just a tool for AI—it is the foundation upon which it thrives.
            </p>
