        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                Neural networks are the foundation of modern AI, driving advancements in image recognition, speech processing, and more. This blog explores their evolution and how they function.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a Neural Network?</h3>
            <p>
                A neural network is a computational system inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of neurons that process and transform input data.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Neural Networks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perceptron:</strong> The simplest form, capable of basic binary classification.</li>
                <li><strong>Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs):</strong> Multiple layers allow for complex decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Used for image processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Applied in sequential data tasks, like speech recognition.</li>
            </ul>
