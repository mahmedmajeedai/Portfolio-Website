                Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a fascinating paradigm within Machine Learning that enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error. Inspired by behavioral psychology, RL empowers machines to interact with their environment, learn from consequences, and maximize long-term rewards. From game-playing AI to robotics, RL has paved the way for groundbreaking advancements.

            <h3>What is Reinforcement Learning?</h3>
            <p>
                Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, which guide its learning process. RL is distinct from supervised learning as it does not rely on labeled data but instead learns from interactions.

            <h3>Key Components of Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agent:</strong> The entity that takes actions to interact with the environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The system within which the agent operates and learns.
                </li>
                <li><strong>State:</strong> A representation of the current situation in the environment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Action:</strong> Choices available to the agent at a given state.</li>
                <li><strong>Reward:</strong> Feedback received by the agent for performing an action. Positive rewards encourage desired behavior, while negative rewards discourage undesirable actions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Core Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Q-Learning:</strong>
                    <p>
                        A model-free RL algorithm that learns a value function to estimate the future rewards of actions. The Q-value helps the agent choose the optimal action for each state.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Deep Q Networks (DQN):</strong>
                    <p>
                        Combines Q-Learning with Deep Learning to handle high-dimensional states like images. DQNs have been instrumental in training AI to play video games like Atari.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Policy Gradient Methods:</strong>
                    <p>
                        These methods learn a policy directly by optimizing the probability of selecting actions that maximize rewards. Common examples include REINFORCE and Actor-Critic algorithms.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
